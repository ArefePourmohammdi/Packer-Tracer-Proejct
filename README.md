# Network Configuration and Testing Project

## Overview

This project involves the configuration and testing of various network protocols and setups using Cisco Packet Tracer. The goal is to create a robust network environment with multiple configurations and features to ensure proper connectivity and functionality.

## Features

- **EtherChannel Configuration**: Set up and tested EtherChannel for link aggregation.
- **HSRP Configuration**: Implemented Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) for router redundancy.
- **SSH Access**: Configured Secure Shell (SSH) for secure remote access.
- **IP Addressing and DHCP**: Managed IP addresses and set up DHCP for automatic address allocation.
- **VLANs and VLAN Management**: Configured VLANs to segment network traffic and improve performance.
- **Black Hole Routing**: Implemented Black Hole routing for testing and troubleshooting.
- **EIGRP Routing**: Configured Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) with bandwidth and delay settings.
- **Port Security**: Applied port security measures to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Ping Tests**: Conducted ping tests to verify connectivity and troubleshoot network issues.
